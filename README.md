## Features
Feature | Description
--------| -----------------------------------------
`F1`     | Gives the resistor values based on the color codes
`F2`     | GIves the reactance values for capacitor and inductor based on the inputs
`F3`     | Gives battery information based on curent input, voltage and circuit type and usage
`F4`     | GIves analysis and output for the following types of circuits: 1) Series 2) parallel 3) RLC (resistive, capacitive and inductive all together)
`F5`     | Gives the power consumption data of a device and also based on the input predicts how long will the device last

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. ### To implement structure as pointers and use as less variables as possible in a menu based system 
    - The challenge was overcome by using typedef, globally declaring structures and passing pointers as arguments in functions.
2. ### To manage time with internship and building and learning the project workflows and github 
    - The challenge was overcome by managing time and starting the day early with tutorals, looking at github accounts for reference and coding at night after learning from various external sites.
3. ### To impleent unit test cases for the first time 
    - The challenge was overcome by watching tutorials, reffering to L&T platforms like Futureskills and ooking at the material given by the company

## References
    *   All the references were taken only for the workflows and makefile from the following git repositories:
        - https://github.com/prithvisekhar/AppliedSDLC_Template.git
        - https://github.com/stepin654321/MiniProject_Template.git

        Rest the code, test cases, the requirements and design were all made manually.
